    Ibadan as a city has suffered from a lot of misconceptions and fallacies, most people that pass through Ibadan on their way to Lagos always believe that they have been to Ibadan which is so wrong on all accounts. Those set of people are not to be blamed though 
    as most people from this ancient city too have been to nooks and crannies so they do not have any idea how Ibadan can be a goldmine when it comes to tourism.
